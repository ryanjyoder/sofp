I still think the problem is multi-dimensional, but I guess we'll just have to wait for the author to clarify :)" CreationDate="2008-09-06T14:30:40.217" UserId="2495" />
  <row Id="16" PostId="47497" Score="1" Text="Indeed, the only way to do this is get the server to generate your CSS file which can be done in many ways depending on which language you are using. HttpHandlers are common in C#.  You could use jQuery or the likes to add styling to every element with the class 'ourColur' and parametrise your JS" CreationDate="2008-09-06T14:42:35.303" UserId="4642" />

I would like to call the Workbench from my backed server as I want to add stuff to my DB simultaneity. therefore I need to use OPTION2 by your words. To my understanding, this example: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-angularjs-singlepageapp has a .NET backend server as there is a Startup.cs file that connects to the AD. In order to get a valid bearer token that will work with my workbench, can I modify this example? Maybe replaces the AD class with another one that supports the &quot;On behalf of flow&quot;?
